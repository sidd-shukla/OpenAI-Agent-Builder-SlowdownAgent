## 🧩 Customization

You can modify the Agent ID inside slowdown_agent.py to point to any Agent you’ve created in your OpenAI workspace.
To change your agent’s behavior:

- Go to your OpenAI Agent Dashboard
- Edit the “Slowdown” Agent’s Instructions or add new tools (Guard Rails, File Search, etc.)
- Re-publish, then update your local SDK snippet if the agent ID changes.

## 🧠 Extending Slowdown

Future ideas for enhancement:

- Integrate Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook via MCP connector to schedule real break reminders.
- Store daily reflection logs in a secure local or cloud database.
